# AirPort Utility (beta)

Apple's AirPort Utility is not guaranteed to run on macOS 27 and newer, so I reverse engineered the application and have reimplemented it for macOS 27 and newer with Swift (front-end code) and Python (backend protocol code). I leveraged Codex to accelerate this work.

I have tested the app with the AirPort models below. However, bugs still remain and there are models I have not tested with. Even for devices that I have tested with, I cannot test all features, such as PPPoE, as I lack the necessary hardware. All contributions are welcome! Please open bug reports for any issues you find and pull requests are greatly appreciated!

### Compilation

The build and runtime requirements are:

- macOS 13 or newer
- Swift 6.0 or newer, provided by Xcode 16 or newer or the corresponding Command Line Tools
- Python 3.10 or newer available on `PATH` as `python3`

The project has no third-party Swift packages or Python packages to install.
AppKit, SwiftUI, Security, Bonjour, and CommonCrypto are provided by macOS.

On a new Mac, install the Command Line Tools:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

If `python3 --version` reports a version older than 3.10, install a newer
Python. For example, with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install python
```

Verify that the required tools are selected:

```sh
swift --version
python3 --version
```

Then compile and run the application from the root of the repository:

```sh
./run.sh
```

### Testing

Run the Swift unit tests from the root of the repository:

```sh
swift test
```

The default test run skips slower subprocess integration tests. Include them
with:

```sh
AIRPORT_UTILITY_SLOW_TESTS=1 swift test
```

Run the Python backend unit tests separately:

```sh
python3 -m unittest Tests/BackendPythonTests/test_backend_modules.py
```

## Build a macOS application

Create an ad-hoc signed app containing the Python backend:

```bash
./build-app.sh
```

Build it and launch the packaged executable from outside the repository for a
snapshot smoke test:

```bash
./build-app.sh --smoke-test
```

The app is written to `.build/release-app/AirPort Utility.app`. Override its
version when needed with `VERSION=1.0.0 BUILD_NUMBER=100 ./build-app.sh`.
The release bundle requires a Python 3 runtime available through
`/usr/bin/env python3`.

Live base-station tests are skipped unless their `AIRPORT_LIVE_*` environment
flags are explicitly set. These tests can change network, password, disk, or
firmware settings on real hardware and are not required for the normal test
suite.

### Recovered AirPort models

The app has been tested with these AirPort models. The app is still likely to work with AirPort models not listed, at least partially. The goal is to fully support all features of all models.

Name | Model | ACP Version | Device-Specific Features
--- | --- | --- | ---
AirPort Express | A1088 | v1 | AirPlay
AirPort Express | A1392 | v2 | AirPlay
AirPort Extreme | A1034 | v1 | Modem, No NAS
AirPort Extreme | A1354 | v2 | NAS
AirPort Extreme | A1521 | v2 | NAS
Time Capsule | A1254 | v2 | NAS, Internal Disk
Time Capsule | A1470 | v2 | NAS, Internal Disk
