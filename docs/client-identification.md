# Client identification

The Dashboard's Connected Clients list adds a vendor name, a guessed device
type, and an optional local nickname to each wireless client, alongside the
existing hostname/IP/signal/rate/PHY columns.

## Vendor lookup

Each client's vendor is looked up from its MAC address's OUI
(Organizationally Unique Identifier — the first three bytes) against a
curated table built from the official IEEE MA-L registry
(`https://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.txt`), filtered down to vendors
common on a home network (Apple, Amazon, Google, Samsung, Sonos, Ubiquiti,
printer and TV manufacturers, and similar). It is not the full registry —
only real, verified entries for those vendors are included, and an
unmatched OUI is reported as no vendor, never a guess.

Two things intentionally prevent a wrong answer:

- **Locally-administered (randomized) addresses are detected and excluded.**
  Modern iOS, Android, and macOS devices commonly randomize their MAC
  address per network specifically to prevent this kind of tracking. The
  app checks the standard locally-administered bit and reports "Private
  address" rather than attempting — and potentially getting wrong — a
  vendor lookup on an address that was never assigned to a real
  manufacturer.
- **Ambiguous multi-category vendors are shown, not used to guess a device
  type.** Samsung, Canon, LG, and similar vendors make products across many
  categories; showing "Samsung" as the vendor is factual, but guessing a
  specific device type from that alone would not be (see below).

## Device-type guessing

A device type (iPhone, Mac, Printer, Speaker, etc.) is shown next to each
client, following the same "never estimate missing data" principle as
[hardware compatibility reporting](hardware-compatibility.md)'s
Recognised/Unrecognised/Unidentified states:

- A hostname that plainly names the device ("Grahams-iPhone") is trusted
  first — it's a much stronger signal than anything derived from the
  vendor.
- Failing that, only a short list of vendors that are, in practice,
  single-purpose on a home network (Sonos, Nintendo, Epson, Brother,
  Ubiquiti, eero) are used to guess a type at all.
- Everything else — including every OEM/chip vendor whose parts end up in
  many different rebranded products (Espressif, Broadcom, Realtek, Hon Hai,
  Murata) and every vendor that makes products across multiple categories —
  is reported as an unknown device type rather than a guess.

## Local nicknames

Right-click (or Control-click) a client in the Connected Clients list to
rename it. The name is stored only on this Mac, keyed by MAC address, at
`~/Library/Application Support/AirPort Utility Powerhouse/ClientIdentity/client-names.json`.
It is never sent to the AirPort or to the device itself, and has no effect
on the device's actual advertised hostname — it only changes what this app
displays.

## What this does not do

- It does not fingerprint devices beyond their MAC address and advertised
  hostname — no traffic inspection, no additional network probing.
- It does not attempt to identify a device more precisely than the
  conservative rules above allow. An "Unknown" device type is the correct,
  honest answer whenever the signal isn't strong enough to be confident.
